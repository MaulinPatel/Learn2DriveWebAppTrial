ASP.NET based website created in group as the part of assignment

Reason to select the topic :

Nowadays a need for a driving school is increasing at the speed of leaps and bounds. And so the need for the websites for them as a proffesional competitor in the field.

We looked for so many driving schools on the internet but there were very few having genuine websites so we wanted to create a website that attract customers as well as make it easier for customers to go through the information of instructors, checkout the rates and book a lesson. It will also give some special authorities to the admin to perform CRUD operations on the data of instructors.

So, this application is the first step towards that mission.

OOP in MVC application : 

Encapsulation : Encapsulation is a component of restricting the information part and part work into a solitary unit known as class.                     Encapsulation gives an approach to reflection. In OOP the embodiment is fundamentally accomplished by making                             classes, the classes uncover open strategies and properties. The class is somewhat of a compartment or case or a                         cell, which embody the arrangement of strategies, credit and properties to give its indented functionalities to                         different classes.

We have created our objects in such a way that they are combined very well and various tasks can be performed with                     ease.

Abstraction   : Data abstraction is a component to give the fundamental highlights without depicting the foundation subtleties. Means                   give the capacities to get to the concealed information. 

The significance of abstraction is gotten from its capacity to conceal immaterial subtleties and from the utilization of                 names to reference objects. Reflection is fundamental in the development of projects. It puts the accentuation on what                   an article is or does instead of how it is spoken to or how it functions. In this manner, it is the essential methods                   for overseeing multifaceted nature in huge projects.
                
Polymophism :  Polymorphism implies one thing in many structure. Essentially polymorphism is ability of one item to carry on in various                manners.In object-situated programming worldview, polymorphism is regularly communicated as 'one interface, various                      capacities'. Polymorphism can be static or dynamic. In static polymorphism, the reaction to a capacity is resolved at the                assemble time. In unique polymorphism, it is chosen at run-time.

Inheritence :  One of the most significant ideas in object-situated writing computer programs is inheritance. Inheritance permits us to                characterize a class as far as another class, which makes it simpler to make and keep up an application. This                            likewise gives a chance to reuse the code usefulness and accelerates usage time.
